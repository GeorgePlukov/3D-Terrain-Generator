# 3D-Terrain-Generator
This project was created for CS 3GC3, computer graphics at mcmaster university. The purpose of the assignment was to become comfortable with rendering in a 3D space in opengl. I created a 3D terrain generator that has two algorithms for generating terrain. It calculates normals for all objects and has two light sources which can be switched between flat sn smooth shading models.

## Usage
Once the github project is downloaded running the command ```make``` should create the executables and run the program. This will also print the instructions and controls to the terminal.
